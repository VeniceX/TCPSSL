## Installation

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    dependencies: [
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/VeniceX/TCPSSL.git", majorVersion: 0, minor: 8)
    ]
)
```

## Example
In this example we'll build a simple "reverse-echo" client and server that utilizes a secure SSL socket for sending and receiving messages.

### Client
The client connects to a server available at `serverFQDN:8443` and sends a string.  It then waits for a response from the server and then exits.

```swift
import TCPSSL

guard Process.arguments.count == 3 else {
  print("Usage:  client serverFQDN string")
  exit(0)
}

let serverFQDN = Process.arguments[1]
let sendData   = Data(Process.arguments[2])

do {
  let connection = try TCPSSLConnection(host:serverFQDN, port:8443)
  try connection.open()
  try connection.send(sendData)
  let data = try connection.receive(upTo:256, timingOut:-1)
} catch {
  print("Client error:  \(error)")
}
```

### Server
The server listens for client SSL connections on port 8443.  Once a secure connection is established with the client the server reads a string sent from the server, reverses it, and then replies back to the client.

```swift
import TCPSSL
import Foundation

guard Process.arguments.count == 4 else {
  print("Usage:  server certificatePath keyPath certificateChainPath")
  exit(0)
}

let certificatePath      = Process.arguments[1]
let keyPath              = Process.arguments[2]
let certificateChainPath = Process.arguments[3]

do {
  let sslServer = try TCPSSLServer(port:8443,
                                   certificate:certificatePath,
                                   privateKey:keyPath,
                                   certificateChain:certificateChainPath)

  while true {
    do {
      let connection = try sslServer.accept(timingOut:-1)
      co {
        do {
          let data = try connection.receive(upTo:256)
          let reversed = String(String(data).characters.reversed())
          try connection.send(Data(reversed), timingOut:-1)
        } catch let dataError {
          print("Client connection error:  \(dataError)")
        }
      }
    } catch {
      print("Server accept error:  \(error)")
    }
  }

} catch let serverError {
  print("Error:  \(serverError)")
}
```

The SSL-based TCP server requires at a minimum a certificate and key, and will likely require a certificate chain (also referred to as a bundle).

It is important to note that the TCPSSL implementation does not allow self-signed certificates, and that the client will match the server certificate's `CommonName` against the FQDN it connected to.

### Running

**Server**

```
# .build/debug/server ssl/bundle.crt ssl/server.yourdomain.key ssl/bundle.crt
Listening for connections
Client connected
Client data received:  Hello world!
Sending data:          !dlrow olleH
```

**Client**

```
.build/debug/client server.yourdomain.org "Hello world\!"
Sending:    Hello world!
Received:  !dlrow olleH
```

## Dependencies
### macOS

TCPSSL utilizes [Zewo/OpenSSL](https://github.com/Zewo/OpenSSL) and as such requires the [Homebrew version](http://brew.sh) of OpenSSL installed:

```
brew install homebrew/versions/openssl101
brew link openssl --force
```

### Linux

Linux requires both `libgnutls-dev` and `libssl-dev` packages to be installed.  On Debian variants this can be accomplished with:

```
apt-get install libgnutls-dev
apt-get install libssl-dev
```
